# Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods #

This capstone project is done as part of the requirements for completion of the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) offered on Coursera.

This capstone project requires me to come up with an idea to leverage the Foursquare location data to explore or compare neighborhoods or cities of my choice or to come up with a problem that I can use the Foursquare location data to solve. 

I have decided to study the distribution and relationship of food courts in Singapore's 55 Planning Areas with population density in each Planning Area.
